<%# Remember, we don't have a model for sessions so this form won't be bound 
to a model object. So when calling the form_with method to generate the form, 
you'll need to use the url option rather than the model option we've used previously. 
The value of the url option needs to be the URL where the form will POST the form data. 
Use a route helper method to generate that URL.  %>

<%= form_with(url: session_path) do |f| %>
  <%= f.label :email %>
  <%= f.email_field :email, autofocus: true, required: true %>
  <%= f.label :password %>
  <%= f.password_field :password, required: true %>

  <%= f.submit "Sign In" %>
<% end %>
