  has_many :fans, through: :favorites, source: :user
  # The through option takes the name of the association through
  # which to perform the query, which is favorites in this case. 
  # It must be declared after the has_many :favorites association. 
  # Since Rails can't infer that a fan is actually a user, 
  # you also need to use the source option to specify that the source
  # is :user. Rails then knows to use the belongs_to :user association 
  # in the Favorite model to query the users.
