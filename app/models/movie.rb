  before_save :set_slug
  # before we save the object to the db, we need to run the
  # private set_slug method, in order to transform the url to
  # our user friendly url and create the slug field of the db entry
  # the set_slug is actually a callback method.

  # (foreign_keys), which are reviews, will also be deleted if
  # the parent gets deleted

  has_many :favorites, dependent: :destroy
  # the model it refers to is favorite but the table is favorites
  # therefore we have to create the association with the table, so
  # by convention this is plural.

  has_many :fans, through: :favorites, source: :user
  # The through option takes the name of the association through
  # which to perform the query, which is favorites in this case. 
  # It must be declared after the has_many :favorites association. 
  # Since Rails can't infer that a fan is actually a user, 
  # you also need to use the source option to specify that the source
  # is :user. Rails then knows to use the belongs_to :user association 
  # in the Favorite model to query the users.
